Github repository for the Foster/Ungar group playing with vector models of words

1) Toefel

2) ploting eigenfeatures

excute colors.R, where you set
    the source file, e.g.  pretty/pretty_4_grams_PHC_10k_30.csv
    the word list

    colors.R calls find_colors.py to generate the intermediate file colors.CSV
    wsd.R  (which takes a different input format)

example words to be looked for are in categories.txt
    and some older ones are in find_colors
